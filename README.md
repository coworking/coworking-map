## A Coworking Sites Map of the World

This simple static git repo creates a google map showing all the coworking sites in stored in another git repo: https://github.com/coworking/coworking-metadata

The data is pulled over as a jsonp payload straight from github. So it is all very open and all very realtime.

We are working on open ways to host the coworking site data, like microformats.
